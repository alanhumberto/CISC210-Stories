# CISC210-Stories

Create a story about the fireball game, create the JIRA issue, create a branch named from the story, write the story into this file
(README.md), and then do a pull request for your changes.
CISC 210/CISC210-159: As a player, I want the fireball to have the same velocity vector as my swipe, so that the fireballs' trajectory is predictable.
Acceptance Criteria: When I swipe my finger on the screen the fireball moves in the same direction and speed as my finger.
